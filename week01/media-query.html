            <h2>Mosiah 2:38</h2>
            <p>Therefore if that man repenteth not, and remaineth and dieth an enemy to God, the demands of divine
                justice do awaken his immortal soul to a lively sense of his own guilt, which doth cause him to shrink
                from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like
                an unquenchable fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</p>

            <h2>Mosiah 2:41</h2>
            <p>And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep
                the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if
                they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in
                a state of never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God
                hath spoken it.</p>
